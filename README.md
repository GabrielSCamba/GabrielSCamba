Professional with 4 years of experience in process automation and in data analysis and engineering projects. Over the past 4 years, I have used English on a daily basis to communicate with colleagues from other regions, both within and outside my team. I began my career in the field of RPA (Robotic Process Automation), working closely with business units to map manual and operational processes that could be automated. This contributed to improvements in quality, speed, and consistency of operations, while freeing up time for employees to focus on more strategic tasks.

As a Data Analyst, I’ve been responsible for identifying critical processes, translating them into relevant KPIs, and developing dashboards that support data-driven decision-making in performance meetings. I work across the entire data lifecycle — from data collection and transformation, to efficient storage and visualization — always aiming to deliver value to the business.

Currently, I am transitioning to Data Engineering, seeking to apply my hands-on experience in data processing and modeling to build scalable pipelines, integrate systems, and develop data-oriented architectures.
